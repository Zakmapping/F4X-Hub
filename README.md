# What is F4X Hub?!
F4X Hub is an Exploit script for Roblox games. It is a ClientSide. You can activate many features. Explore it in the exploit. It has an interface suitable for all devices. 

# How to use F4X Hub?!:
1- There is a loadstring under this message, copy it and paste it in any executor.
